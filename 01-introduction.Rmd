## Who should read this book
This book is for everyone who wants to learn how to make machine learning models more explainable.

It is a recommended reading for machine learning practitioners, statisticians, data scientists, scientists and everyone who has contact with machine learning applications. It contains one or the other formula, but it's kept at a manageable level of math.
This book is not for people who are trying to learn machine learning from scratch. If you want to learn machine learning, there are loads of books and other resources for learning the basics.


## Outline
This book starts out with framing the problem: What aspects does explainability have? It goes on and lays out the 'simple'
machine learning models (linear models, decision trees, decision rules) that are interpretable. The following chapter explains different methods for explaining and understanding the data better, followed by the core chapter about methods for explaining the output of any black box model. Later methods that are specific for certain model classes are shown. The book concludes with an outlook on the future.


## What is machine learning and why is it important?

So what is machine learning?
In general we speak of predictive models, that take some input vector (features) and map it to an output. If the output is a categorical variable people often name it classification and if it is a numerical variable, then regression.
Machine learning is a set of algorithms that can learn these mappings from training data, which are pairs of input features and output variable. The machine learning algorithm learns a model by changing parameters (like linear weights) or learning structures (like trees). The algorithm is guided by a score or loss function that is minimized. A fully trained machine learning model can then be used to make predictions for new instances.


Recommendation of products, identifying street signs, counting people on the street, assessing a person's credit worthiness, detecting fraud: All these examples have in common that they can, and are increasingly, realized with machine learning models. The tasks are different, but the approach is the same: Step 1 is to collect data. This can be images with and without street signs plus the information which sign is visible or the personal data from loan applicants together with the information if they repaid their loan or not. Step 2: Feed this information into a machine learning algorithm, which produces a sign detector model or a credit worthiness model. This model can then be used in Step 3: Integrate the model into the product or process, like an self-driving car or a loan application process.

There are a lot of tasks in which machines exceed humans. Even if the machine is as good as a human at a task, or slightly worse, there remains big advantages, and that is speed, reproducibility and scale. A machine learning model that has been implemented once, can do a task much faster than humans, will reliably produce the same results from the same input and can be copied endlessly.


## Definitions
- An **Algorithm** is a set of rules that a machine follows to achieve a particular goal [@algorithm]
- **Machine learning algorithm** is an set of rules that a machine follows to learn how to a achieve a particular goal. The output of a machine learning algorithm is a machine learning model.
- **(Machine learning) Model** is the outcome of a machine learning algorithm. This can be a set of weights for a linear model or neural network plus the architecture.
- **Features** are the variables/information used for prediction/classification/clustering.
- **(machine learning) Task** can be classification, regression, survival analysis, clustering, outlier detection
- **Instance** One row in the dataset.
