# Model-agnostic explanations

## Global: Explain behaviour of system with data
### Global surrogate models
A surrogate model is a simple, explainable model that explains a complex machine learning model.
### Partial dependency plots
Partial dependency plots show the relationship between the target and one or more features by averaging out all the other features. A dependency plot can show if the relationship between target and feature is linear, monotonic or something else.
Are only partially global: It is global because it takes into account all instances, but it is local in the feature, because partial dependency plots only examine one variable, as the name suggests.
### Individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot
### Variable importance
### LOCO (Leave-One-Covariate-Out)
### Interactions
### Residual analysis
A residual value is the difference of the models prediction and the actual value.
### Confusion matrix
### Sensitivity analysis of predictions
Testing the stability of the model predictions/classifications using simulated data. It can help to trust the model to not be instable in certain settings.



## Local: Explain single decisions
### Local surrogate models (LIME)
LIME is also a surrogate model, but it is a local one.
## Maximum activation analysis
### LOCO (Leave-One-Covariate-Out) also local 
### Max points lost
Compare individual prediction with 'ideal' case (maximum probability) in terms of points lost per feature. Only works with monotonicity. And ideal case candidate maxes out each feature regarding highest probability of interest. The feature in which the instance is farthest away from the ideal case is the most negative point, why it should not be in class of interest. Feature with point closest to ideal is the least negative reason.
