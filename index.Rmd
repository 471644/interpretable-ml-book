# Preface {-}

This book is about explainable artificial intelligence, focusing on machine learning models. Machine learning is being built into many products and processes of our daily lives, yet decisions made by machines don't automatically come any explanation. An explanation increases the trust in the decision and in the machine learning model. As the programmer of an algorithm you want to know whether you can trust the learned model. Did it learn generalizable features? Or are there some odd artifacts in the training data which the algorithm picked up? This book will give an overview over techniques that can be used to make black boxes as transparent as possible and explain decisions. In the first chapter algorithms that produce simple, explainable models are introduced together with instructions how to interpret the output. The later chapters focus on analyzing complex models and their decisions.
In an ideal future, machines will be able to explain their decisions and make a transition into an algorithmic age more human.  

 This books is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians and also for stakeholders deciding on the use of machine learning and intelligent algorithms.
