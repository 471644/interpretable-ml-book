# Preface {-}

This book is about interpretable machine learning: Making machine decisions interpretable. Machine learning is being integrated into many products and processes of our daily lives, yet decisions made by machines don't automatically come with an explanation. An explanation increases the trust in the decision and in the machine learning model. As the programmer of an algorithm you want to know whether you can trust the learned model. Did it learn generalizable features? Or are there some odd artifacts in the training data which the algorithm picked up? This book will give you an overview over techniques that you can use to make black boxes as transparent as possible and make their predictions interpretable. The first part of the book introduces algorithms that produce simple, interpretable models and instructions how to interpret the output. The later chapters focus on general tools that help analyzing complex models and making their decisions interpretable.
In an ideal future, machines will be able to explain their decisions and make a transition into an algorithmic age more human.

This books is recommended for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, statisticians and anyone else interested in making machine decisions more human.


**About me:** My name is Christoph Molnar, I consider myself both a statistician and machine learner. I work as a data scientist and also offer courses in interpretable machine learning. If you are interested in bringing intepretability to your machine learning models, feel free to contact me!
