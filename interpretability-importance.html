<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Importance of Interpretability</h2>
<p>If a machine learning model performs well, <strong>why not just trust the model</strong> and ignore <strong>why</strong> it made a certain decision?</p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the reasons why interpretability is so important. In predictive modeling, you have to make a trade-off: Do you simply want to know <strong>what</strong> is predicted? For example the probability that a client will churn or how effective some medication will be for a patient. Or do you want to know <strong>why</strong> the prediction was made and possibly paying for the interpretability with a drop in accuracy? In some cases you don’t care why a decision was made, only the assurance that the predictive performance was good on a test dataset is enough. But in other cases, knowing the ‘why’ can help you understand more about the problem, the data and why a model might fail. Some models might not need explanations, because they are used in a low risk environment, meaning a mistake has no severe consequences, (e.g. a movie recommender system) or the method has already been extensively studied and evaluated (e.g. optical character recognition). The necessity for interpretability comes from an incompleteness in the problem formalization <span class="citation">(Doshi-Velez and Kim <a href="#ref-Doshi-Velez2017">2017</a>)</span>, meaning that for certain problems or tasks it is not enough to get the answer (the <strong>what</strong>). The model also has to give an explanation how it came to the answer (the <strong>why</strong>), because a correct prediction only partially solves your original problem. The following reasons drive the demand for interpretability and explanations (<span class="citation">Doshi-Velez and Kim (<a href="#ref-Doshi-Velez2017">2017</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Miller (<a href="#ref-miller2017explanation">2017</a>)</span>):</p>
<p><strong>Human curiosity and learning</strong>: Humans have a mental model of their environment, which gets updated when something unexpected happens. This update is done by finding an explanation for the unexpected event. For example, a human feels unexpectedly sick and asks himself: “Why do I feel so sick?”. He learns that he becomes sick every time he eats those red berries. He updates his mental model and decides that the berries caused the sickness and therefore should be avoided. Curiosity and learning is important for any machine learning model used in the research context, where scientific findings stay completely hidden, when the machine learning model only gives predictions without explanations. To facilitate learning and satisfy curiosity about why certain predictions or behaviors are created by machines, interpretability and explanations are crucial. Of course, humans don’t need an explanation for everything that happens. Most people are okay with not understanding how a computer works. The emphasis of this point is more on unexpected events, that makes us curious. Like: Why is my computer shutting down unexpectedly?</p>
Closely related to learning is the human desire to <strong>find meaning in the world</strong>. We want to reconcile contradictions or inconsistencies between elements of our knowledge structures. “Why did my dog bite me, even though it has never done so before?” a human might ask himself. There is a contraction between the knowledge about the dog’s past behavior and the newly made, unpleasant experience of the bite. The explanation of the vet reconciles the dog holders contradiction: “The dog was under stress and did bite, dogs are animals and this can happen.” The more a machine’s decision affects a human’s life, the more important it will be for the machine to explain its behavior. When a machine learning model rejects a loan application, this could be quite unexpected for the applicant. He can only reconcile this inconsistency between expectation and reality by having some form of explanation. As we will learn in Chapter <a href="explanation.html#explanation">2.4</a>, the explanations don’t actually have to fully explain the situation, but should address a main cause. Another example is algorithmic product recommendation. Personally, I always reflect on why certain products or movies have been recommended to me algorithmically. Often it is quite clear: The advertising is following me on the Internet because I have bought a washing machine recently, and I know that I will be followed by washing machine advertisements the next days. Yes, it makes sense to suggest gloves, when I already have a winter hat in my shopping basket. The algorithm recommended this movie, because users that liked other movies that I also liked, enjoyed the recommended movie. Increasingly, Internet companies are adding explanations to their recommendations. A good example is the Amazon product recommendation based on frequently bought product combinations, see Figure <a href="interpretability-importance.html#fig:amazon-recommendation">2.1</a>.

<p>There is a shift in many scientific disciplines from qualitative to quantitative methods (e.g. sociology, psychology), and also towards machine learning (biology, genomics). The <strong>goal of science</strong> is to gain knowledge, but many problems can only be solved with big datasets and black box machine learning models. The model itself becomes a source of knowledge, instead of the data. Interpretability allows to tap into this additional knowledge captured by the model.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are taking over real world tasks, that demand <strong>safety measurements</strong> and testing. Imagine a self-driving car automatically detects cyclists, which is as desired. You want to be 100% sure that the abstraction the system learned will be fail-safe, because running over cyclists is quite bad. An explanation might reveal that the most important feature learned is to recognize the two wheels of a bike and this explanation helps you to think about edge cases like bikes with side bags, that partially cover the wheels.</p>
<p>By default most machine learning models pick up biases from the training data. This can turn your machine learning models into racists which discriminate against protected groups. Interpretability is a useful debugging tool to <strong>detect bias</strong> in machine learning models. It might happen that the machine learning model you trained for automatically approving or rejecting loan applications discriminates against some minority. Your main goal is to give out loans to people that will pay them back eventually. In this case, the incompleteness in the problem formulation lies in the fact that you not only want to minimize loan defaults, but you are also required to not discriminate based on certain demographics. This is an additional constraint, which is part of your problem formulation (Handing out loans in a low-risk and compliant way), which is not captured by the loss function, which the machine learning model optimizes.</p>
<p>The process of integrating machines and algorithms into our daily lives demands interpretability to increase <strong>social acceptance</strong>. People attribute beliefs, desires, intentions and so on to objects. In a famous experiment, <span class="citation">Heider and Simmel (<a href="#ref-heider1944experimental">1944</a>)</span> showed the participants videos of shapes, where a circle opened a door to enter a “room” (which was simply a rectangle). The participants described the actions of the shapes as they would describe the actions of a human agent, attributing intentions and even emotions and personality traits to the shapes. Robots are a good example, like my vacuum cleaner, which I named ‘Doge’. When Doge gets stuck, I think: “Doge wants to continue cleaning, but asks me for help because it got stuck.” Later, when Doge finished cleaning and searches the home base to recharge I think: “Doge has the desire to recharge and intents to find the home base”. Also I attribute personality traits: “Doge is a bit dumb, but in a cute way”. These are my thoughts, especially when I find out that Doge threw over some plant while cleaning the house dutifully. A machine or algorithm explaining its prediction will receive more acceptance. See also Chapter <a href="explanation.html#explanation">2.4</a>, which argues that explanations are a social process.</p>
Explanations are used to <strong>manage social interactions</strong>. Through the creation of a shared meaning of something, the explainer influences the actions, emotions and beliefs of the receiver of the explanation. In order to allow a machine to interact with us, it might need to shape our emotions and beliefs. Machines have to “persuade” us, so that we believe that they can achieve their intended goal. I would not completely accept my robot vacuum cleaner if it would not explain its behavior to some degree. The vacuum cleaner creates a shared meaning of, for example, an “accident” (like getting stuck on the bathroom carpet … again) by explaining that it got stuck, instead of simply stopping to work without comment. Interestingly, there can be a misalignment between the goal of the explaining machine, which is generating trust, and the goal of the recipient, which is to understand the prediction or behavior. Maybe the correct explanation why Doge got stuck could be that the battery was very low, additionally one of the wheels is not working properly and on top of that there is a bug that causes the robot to re-try to go to the same spot over and over again, even though there was some obstacle in the way. These reasons (and some more) caused the robot to get stuck, but it only explained that there was something in the way, and this was enough for me to trust its behavior, and to get a shared meaning of that accident, which I can share with my girlfriend. (“By the way, Doge got stuck again in the bathroom, we have to remove the carpets before we let it clean”). The example of the robot getting stuck on the carpet might not even require an explanation, because I can explain it to myself by observing that Doge can’t move on this carpet mess, see Figure @ref{fig:doge-stuck} But there are other situations, which are less obvious, like a full dirt bag.

<p>Only with interpretability can machine learning algorithms be <strong>debugged and audited</strong>. So even in low risk environments, like movie recommendation, interpretability in the research and development stage as well as after deployment is valuable. Because later, when some model is used in a product, things can go wrong. Having an interpretation for a faulty prediction helps to understand the cause of the fault. It delivers a direction for how to fix the system. Consider an example of a husky versus wolf classifier, that misclassifies some huskies as wolfs. Using interpretable machine learning methods, you would find out that the misclassification happened due to the snow on the image. The classifier learned to use snow as a feature for classifying images as wolfs, which might make sense in terms of separating features in the training data set, but not in the real world use.</p>
<p>If you can ensure that the machine learning model can explain decisions, the following traits can also be checked more easily <span class="citation">(Doshi-Velez and Kim <a href="#ref-Doshi-Velez2017">2017</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fairness: Making sure the predictions are unbiased and not discriminating against protected groups (implicit or explicit). An interpretable model can tell you why it decided that a certain person is not worthy of a credit and for a human it becomes easier to judge if the decision was based on a learned demographic (e.g. racial) bias.</li>
<li>Privacy: Ensuring that sensitive information in the data is protected.</li>
<li>Reliability or Robustness: Test that small changes in the input don’t lead to big changes in the prediction.</li>
<li>Causality: Check if only causal relationships are picked up. Meaning a predicted change in a decision due to arbitrary changes in the input values are also happening in reality.</li>
<li>Trust: It is easier for humans to trust into a system that explains it’s decisions compared to a black box.</li>
</ul>
