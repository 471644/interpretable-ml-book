Logistic Regression
-------------------

Logistic regression is the linear regression model made fit for
classification problems.

### What's Wrong with Linear Regression Models for Classification?

The linear regression model works well in regression setups, but fails
in the classification case. Why is that? In case of two classes, you
could label one of the classes with 0 and the other with 1 and use a
linear model on it and it would estimate the weights for you. There are
just a few problems with that approach:

-   A linear model does not output probabilities, but it treats the
    classes as numbers (0 and 1) and fits the best hyperplane (if you
    have one feature, it's a line) that minimises the distances between
    the points and the hyperplane. So it simply interpolates between the
    points, but there is no meaning in it and you cannot interpret it as
    probabilities.
-   Also a linear model will extrapolate the features and give you
    values below zero and above one, which are not meaningful and should
    tell you that there might be a more clever approach to
    classification.
-   Since the predicted outcome is not a probability but some linear
    interpolation between points there is no meaningful threshold at
    which you can distinguish one class from the other. A good
    illustration of this issue was given on
    [Stackoverflow](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22381/why-not-approach-classification-through-regression),
    which I reproduced in Figure @ref(fig:linear-class-threshold)
-   Linear models don't extend to classification problems with multiple
    classes. You would have to start labeling the next class with a 2,
    then 3 and so on. The classes might not have any meaningful order,
    but the linear model would force a weird structure on the
    relationship between the features and your class predictions. So for
    a feature with a positive weight, the higher the value of that
    feature the more it contributes to the prediction of a class with a
    higher number, even if classes that happened to get a similar number
    are not related at all.

### Logistic Regression

A solution for classification is logistic regression. Instead of fitting
a straight line or hyperplane, the logistic regression model uses a
non-linear function, the logistic function to squeeze the output of a
linear equation between 0 and 1. The logistic function is defined as:
$$ \\text{logistic}(\\eta) = \\frac{1}{1 + exp(-\\eta)}$$
 And it looks like shown in Figure @ref(fig:logistic-function).

    logistic = function(x){1 / (1 + exp(-x))}

    x = seq(from=-6, to = 6, length.out = 100)
    df = data.frame(x = x,
      y = logistic(x))
    ggplot(df) + geom_line(aes(x=x,y=y)) + my_theme()

<img src="04.3-interpretable-logistic_files/figure-markdown_strict/logistic-function-1.png" alt="The logistic function. It only outputs numbers between 0 and 1. At input 0 it outputs 0.5." width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
The logistic function. It only outputs numbers between 0 and 1. At input
0 it outputs 0.5.
</p>

The step from linear regression models to logistic regression is kind of
straightforward. In the linear regression model we modelled the
relationship between the outcome and the features with a linear
equation:
$$\\hat{y}\_{i} = \\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} \\cdot x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p} $$
 For the classification we prefer probabilities, which are between 0 and
1, so we wrap the right side of the equation into the logistic
regression function and like that force the output to only take on
values between 0 and 1.
$$P(y\_{i}=1) =  \\frac{1}{1 + exp(-(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} \\cdot x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}))}$$

Let's revisit the tumour size example from Figure
@ref(fig:linear-class-threshold) again. But now instead of the linear
regression model, we use the logistic regression model:

    logistic1 = glm(y ~ x, family = binomial, data = df.lin.log[df.lin.log$case == '0.5 threshold ok',])

    ## Warning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

    logistic2 = glm(y ~ x, family = binomial, data = df.lin.log)

    ## Warning: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge

    ## Warning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

    lgrid = data.frame(x = seq(from=0, to=20, length.out=100))
    lgrid$y1_pred = predict(logistic1, newdata = lgrid, type='response')
    lgrid$y2_pred = predict(logistic2 , newdata = lgrid, type='response')


    p1 = ggplot(df.lin.log, aes(x=x,y=y)) +
      geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y1_pred), data = lgrid, color='blue', size=1) +
      geom_point(position = position_jitter(width=0, height=0.02)) +
      my_theme() +
      scale_y_continuous('Tumour class', breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c('benign tumour', '0.5',  'malignant tumour'), limits = c(-0.1,1.3)) +
      scale_x_continuous('Tumour size') +
      facet_grid(. ~ case) +
      geom_hline(yintercept=0.5, linetype = 3)

    p1

![The logistic regression model successfully finds the correct decision
boundary to distinguish between malignant and benign tumours dependent
on the size of the tumour in this example. The blue line is the logistic
function shifted and squeezed so that it fits the
data.](04.3-interpretable-logistic_files/figure-markdown_strict/logistic-class-threshold-1.png)
It works better with logistic regression and we can use 0.5 as a
threshold in both cases. Including the additional points does not affect
the estimated curve much.

### Interpretation

The interpretation of the logistic regression weights differs from the
linear regression case, because in logistic regression the outcome is a
probability between 0 and 1, and the weights don't affect the
probability linearly, but are squeezed through the logistic function.
That's why we need to reformulate the equation for the interpretation,
so that there is only the linear term left on the right side of the
formula.

$$log\\left(\\frac{P(y\_{i}=1)}{1 - P(y\_{i}=1)}\\right) =  log\\left(\\frac{P(y\_{i}=1)}{ P(y\_{i}=0)}\\right) = \\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}$$

$\\frac{P(y\_{i}=1)}{1 - P(y\_{i}=1)}$ is also called odds (probability
of event divided by probability of no event) and
$log\\left(\\frac{P(y\_{i}=1)}{1 - P(y\_{i}=1)}\\right)$ is called log
odds. So with a logistic regression model we have a linear model for the
log odds. Great! Doesn't sound helpful! Well, with a bit of shuffling
again, you can find out how the prediction changes, when one of the
features *x*<sub>*j*</sub> is changed by 1 point. For this we can first
apply the *e**x**p*() function on both sides of the equation:

$$\\frac{P(y\_{i}=1)}{(1 - P(y\_{i}=1))} = odds\_i =  exp\\left(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} \\cdot x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}\\right)$$

Then we compare what happens when we increase one of the
*x*<sub>*i*,â€†*j*</sub> by 1. But instead of looking at the difference,
we look at the ratio of the two predictions:

$$ \\frac{odds\_{i, x\_j + 1}}{odds\_i}= \\frac{exp\\left(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{j} (x\_{i,j} + 1)  + \\ldots+ \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}\\right)}{exp\\left(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{j} x\_{i,j}  + \\ldots+ \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}\\right)}$$

Using the rule that $\\frac{exp(a)}{exp(b)} = exp(a - b)$ gives us:

$$
\\begin{aligned}
\\frac{odds\_{i, x\_j + 1}}{odds\_i} &  = & exp\\left(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} \\cdot x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{j} \\cdot (x\_{i,j} + 1)  + \\ldots+ \\beta\_{i,p}x\_{i,p}\\right) \\\\
& & - exp\\left(\\beta\_{0} + \\beta\_{1} \\cdot x\_{i,1} + \\ldots + \\beta\_{j} \\cdot x\_{i,j}  + \\ldots+ \\beta\_{p} x\_{i,p}\\right)
\\end{aligned}
$$

And then we can remove a lot of terms from the equation, which is
convenient:
$$ \\frac{odds\_{i, x\_j + 1}}{odds\_i}=  exp\\left( \\beta\_{j} (x\_{i,j} + 1) - \\beta\_{j} x\_{i,j} \\right) = exp\\left(\\beta\_j\\right)$$

And we end up with something simple like exp(*Î²*<sub>*j*</sub>). So a
change of *x*<sub>*j*</sub> by one unit changes the odds ratio
(multiplicatively) by a factor of exp(*Î²*<sub>*j*</sub>). We could also
interpret it this way: A change in *x*<sub>*j*</sub> by one unit changes
the log odds ratio by *Î²*<sub>*j*</sub> units, but most people do the
former because thinking about the *l**o**g*() of something is known to
be hard on the brain. Interpreting the odds ratio already needs a bit of
getting used to. For example if you have odds of 2, it means that the
probability for *y*<sub>*i*</sub>â€„=â€„1 is twice as big as
*y*<sub>*i*</sub>â€„=â€„0. If you have a *Î²*<sub>*j*</sub> (=odds ratio) of
0.7, then an increase in the respective *x*<sub>*j*</sub> by one unit
multiplies the odds by exp(0.7)â‰ˆ2 and the odds change to 4. But usually
you don't deal with the odds and only interpret the *Î²*'s as the odds
ratios. Because for actually calculating the odds you would need to set
a value for each feature *x*<sub>*j*</sub>, which only makes sense if
you want to look at one specific instance of your dataset.

Here are the interpretations for the logistic regression model with
different feature types:

-   Numerical feature: For an increase of one unit of the feature
    *x*<sub>*j*</sub>, the estimated odds change (multiplicatively) by a
    factor of exp(*Î²*<sub>*j*</sub>)
-   Binary categorical feature: One of the two values of the feature is
    the reference level (in some languages the one that was coded in 0).
    A change of the feature *x*<sub>*j*</sub> from the reference level
    to the other level changes the estimated odds (multiplicatively) by
    a factor of exp(*Î²*<sub>*j*</sub>)
-   Categorical feature with many levels: One solution to deal with many
    possible feature values is to one-hot-encode them, meaning each
    level gets its own column. From a categorical feature with L levels,
    you only need L-1 columns, otherwise it is over-parameterised. The
    interpretation for each level is then according to the binary
    features.
-   Intercept *Î²*<sub>0</sub>: Given all numerical features are zero and
    the categorical features are at the reference level, the estimated
    odds are exp(*Î²*<sub>0</sub>). The interpretation of *Î²*<sub>0</sub>
    is usually not relevant.

### Example

We use the logistic regression model to predict cervical cancer given
some risk factors. The data are described in Chapter @ref(cervical)

    data("cervical")
    neat_cervical_names = c('Intercept', 'Hormonal contraceptives y/n',
      'Smokes y/n', 'Num. of pregnancies',
      'Num. of diagnosed STDs',
      'Intrauterine device y/n')

    # Fit logistic model for probability of cancer, use few features that are interesting
    mod = glm(Biopsy ~ Hormonal.Contraceptives + Smokes + Num.of.pregnancies + STDs..Number.of.diagnosis + IUD,
      data = cervical, family = binomial())
    # Print table of coef, exp(coef), std, p-value
    coef.table = summary(mod)$coefficients[,c('Estimate', 'Std. Error')]
    coef.table = cbind(coef.table, 'Odds ratio' = as.vector(exp(coef.table[, c('Estimate')])))
    # Interpret one numerical and one factor
    rownames(coef.table) = neat_cervical_names
    colnames(coef.table)[1] = 'Weight'
    kable(coef.table[, c('Weight', 'Odds ratio', 'Std. Error')], digits=2, caption='The results from fitting a logistic regression model on the cervical cancer dataset. Shown are the features used in the model, their estimated weights and according odds ratios and the standard errors of the estimated weights.')

Interpretation of a numerical feature ('Num. of diagnosed STDs'): An
increase of the number of diagnosed STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)
changes (decreases) the odds for cancer vs. no cancer multiplicatively
by 0.44, given all other features stay the same. Keep in mind that
correlation does not imply causation. No recommendation here to get
STDs.

Interpretation of a categorical feature ('Hormonal contraceptives y/n'):
For women with hormonal contraceptives, the odds for cancer vs. no
cancer are by a factor of 1.12 higher, compared to women without
hormonal contraceptives, given all other features stay the same.

Again as in the linear models, the interpretations are always coming
with the clause that 'all other features stay the same'.
