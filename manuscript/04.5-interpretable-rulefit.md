A made up example for the bike rental data set:
{$$}r_{17}(x)=I(x_{\text{temp}}<15)\cdot{}I(x_{\text{weather}}\in\{\text{good},\text{cloudy}\})\cdot{}I(10\leq{}x_{\text{windspeed}}<20){/$$}
This rule will only be equal to 1 if all of the three conditions are met, otherwise 0.
RuleFit extracts all possible rules from a tree, not only from the leaf nodes.
So another rule that would be created is:
{$$}r_{18}(x)=I(x_{\text{temp}}<15)\cdot{}I(x_{\text{weather}}\in\{\text{good},\text{cloudy}\}{/$$}
In total, {$$}K=\sum_{m=1}^M2(t_m-1){/$$} rules are created from the ensemble of {$$}M{/$$} trees, with {$$}t_m{/$$} terminal nodes each.
A trick that is introduced by the RuleFit authors is to fit trees with random depth, so that a lot of diverse rules are generated with different lengths.
Note that we throw away the predicted value in each node and only keep the conditions that lead us to the node and create a rule from it.
The weighting of the decision rules will happen in step 2 of fitting RuleFit.
