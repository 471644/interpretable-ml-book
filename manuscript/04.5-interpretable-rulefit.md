Another way to see the first step is, that it generates a new set of features {$$}X'{/$$} out of your original features {$$}X{/$$}.
Those features are binary and can represent quite complex interactions of your original {$$}X{/$$}.
The rules are chosen to maximise the prediction task at hand.
The rules are automatically generated from the covariates matrix X.
You can see the rules simply as new features based on your original features.
