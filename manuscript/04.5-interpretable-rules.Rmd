# Decision Rules

Simply if-else statements, learned by a machine learning algorithm.


Can be derived from decision trees, but don't have to.


## What are decision rules

Decision rules are a class of machine learning model that consists of if X then Y statements. Within the if statement there are sets of features and conditions on them (like X > 4) and Y is a statement about the outcome of interest.
One decision rule from a model predicting rents could be:

If a flat is bigger than 100 square meters and has a garden the average rent is 2000 Euro per month.

Let's split that up:
- 'Flat is bigger than 100 square meters' is the first part of the IF statement
- 'Flat has a garden' is a second conditions in the IF.
- Both are connected with an 'AND', so both have to be true for the rule to apply
- Predicted outcome (THEN) is that the average rent is 2000 Euro per month.

RULE: IF CONDITIONS THEN TARGET

Arguably decision rules are the most simple classifier in terms of understandability. They are very close to natural language and the way we think. Of course it relies on using sensible, understandable features and the number of conditions within the if statement.

Usually there is more then one rule to describe the associations of the features with the outcome. In our example we only have one rule covering big appartments with flats, but what about a smaller apartment?

Rules can be induced from trees. Each path through the tree is one rule. Rules made of trees have the nice

There are many ways how to induce those kind of rules from a training dataset.
The induction algorithms differ in how they create the rules:
- Do they allow overlapping rules and how are conflicts handled?
- Do they cover the whole training set?
