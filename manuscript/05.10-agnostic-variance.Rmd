## Analysis of Variance {#variance}

Analyse how much the model predictions vary.



### ANOVA

### Sobol
Very short


**First order indices**

**Second order indices**

### Shapley


### Example

TODO: Show both Sobol and Shapley to emphasize the difference

**Bike sharing**

**Cervical cancer**


### Advantages
Compare it mainly to feature importance
- Tells you what the model does
- Analysis that is completely underrated, actually I have never seen anything like this in a paper. 
Maybe it means that it is not necessary?
I don't believe so, because the ANOVA, it's counter part, or also the linear model is used heavily. 
Basically anytime you read "variancce explained".

### Disadvantages
- Not coupled to performance of model. 
A feature can vary the output lots, but not much difference in the prediction performance.
- Sobol only works for independent inputs, Shapley is cost intensive.
-
