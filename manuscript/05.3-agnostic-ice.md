Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Plot
---------------------------------------------

The partial dependence plot for visualising the average effect of a
feature is a global method, because it does not focus on specific
instances, but on an overall average. The equivalent to a PDP for local
expectations is called individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot
\[@goldstein2015peeking\]. An ICE plot visualises the dependence of the
predicted response on a feature for EACH instance separately, resulting
in multiple lines, one for each instance, compared to one line in
partial dependence plots. A PDP is the average of the lines of an ICE
plot. The values for a line (and one instance) can be computed by
leaving all other features the same, creating variants of this instance
by replacing the feature's value with values from a grid and letting the
black box make the predictions with these newly created instances. The
result is a set of points for an instance with the feature value from
the grid and the respective predictions.

So, what do you gain by looking at individual expectations, instead of
partial dependencies? Partial dependence plots can obfuscate a
heterogeneous relationship that comes from interactions. PDPs can show
you how the average relationship between feature *x*<sub>*S*</sub> and
$\\hat{y}$ looks like. This works only well in cases where the
interactions between *x*<sub>*S*</sub> and the remaining
*x*<sub>*C*</sub> are weak. In case of interactions, the ICE plot will
give a lot more insight.

A more formal definition: In ICE plots, for each instance in
{(*x*<sub>*S*<sub>*i*</sub></sub>, *x*<sub>*C*<sub>*i*</sub></sub>)}<sub>*i* = 1</sub><sup>*N*</sup>
the curve $\\hat{f}\_S^{(i)}$ is plotted against
*x*<sub>*S*<sub>*i*</sub></sub>, while *x*<sub>*C*<sub>*i*</sub></sub>
is kept fixed.

### Example

Let's go back to the dataset about risk factors for cervical cancer from
Chapter @ref(cervical) and see how each instance's prediction is
associated with the feature 'Age'. The model we will analyse is a
RandomForest that predicts the probability of cancer for a woman given
risk factors. In the partial dependence plot from Chapter @ref(pdp) we
have seen that the cancer probability increases around the age of 50,
but does it hold true for each woman in the dataset? The ICE plot
(Figure @ref(fig:ice-cervical)) reveals that the most women's predicted
probability follows the average pattern of increase at 50, but there are
a few exceptions: For the few women that have a high predicted
probability at a young age, the predicted cancer probability does not
change much with increasing age.

Figure @ref(fig:ice-bike) shows an ICE plot for the bike rental
prediction (the underlying prediction model is a RandomForest). The data
is described in Chapter @ref(bike-data). All curves seem to follow the
same course, so there seem to be no obvious interactions. That means
that the PDP is already a good summary of the relationships of the
displayed features and the predicted bike rentals.

#### Centred ICE Plot

There is one issue with ICE plots: It can be hard to see if the
individual conditional expectation curves differ between individuals,
because they start at different $\\hat{f}(x)$. An easy fix is to centre
the curves at a certain point in *x*<sub>*S*</sub> and only display the
difference in the predicted response. The resulting plot is called
centred ICE plot (c-ICE). Anchoring the curves at the lower end of
*x*<sub>*S*</sub> is a good choice. The new curves are defined as:
$$\\hat{f}\_{cent}^{(i)} = \\hat{f}\_i - \\mathbf{1}\\hat{f}(x^{\\text{\*}}, x\_{C\_i}), $$
 where **1** is a vector of 1's with the appropriate number of
dimensions (usually one- or two-dimensional), $\\hat{f}$ the fitted
model and *x*<sup>\*</sup> the anchor point.

#### Example

Taking the plot in Figure @ref(fig:ice-cervical) and centring the lines
at the youngest observed age yields Figure
@ref(fig:ice-cervical-centered). With the centred ICE plots it is easier
to compare the curves of individual instances. This can be useful when
we are not interested in seeing the absolute change of a predicted
value, but rather the difference in prediction compared to a fixed point
of the feature range.

The lines are fixed to 0 at age 13 and each point shows the difference to the prediction with age 13. Compared to age 18, the predictions for most instances stay the same and see an increase up to 20 percent. A few cases show the opposite behaviour: The predicted probability decreases with increasing age." width="80%" />

#### Derivative ICE Plot

Another way to make it visually easier to spot heterogeneity is to look
at the individual derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ with respect to
*x*<sub>*S*</sub> instead of the predicted response $\\hat{f}$. The
resulting plot is called derivative ICE plot (d-ICE). The derivatives of
a function (or curve) tell you in which direction changes occur and if
any occur at all. With the derivative ICE plot it is easy to spot value
ranges in a feature where the black box's predicted values change for
(at least some) instances. If there is no interaction between
*x*<sub>*S*</sub> and *x*<sub>*C*</sub>, then $\\hat{f}$ can be
expressed as:
$$\\hat{f}(x) = \\hat{f}(x\_S, x\_C) = g(x\_S) + h(x\_C), \\text{ so that } \\frac{\\delta\\hat{f}(x)}{\\delta x\_S} = g'(x\_S)$$
 Without interactions, the individual partial derivatives should be the
same for all instances. If they differ, it is because of interactions
and it will become visible in the d-ICE plot. In addition to displaying
the individual curves for derivative $\\hat{f}$, showing the standard
deviation of derivative $\\hat{f}$ helps to highlight regions in
*x*<sub>*S*</sub> with heterogeneity in the estimated derivatives.

#### Example

As we have seen, the most changes in estimated cancer probability happen
around age 45. This is confirmed by the derivative ICE plot in Figure
@ref(fig:ice-cervical-derivative).
<img src="images/ice-cervical-derivative-1.png" alt="Derivative ICE plot of predicted cancer probability by age. Between age 14 and the early forties, a few instance see changes in prediction both upwards and downwards, but the majorities derivatives are near zero. Between age 45 and 50, most women's prediction curves have a positive derivative, indicating an increase in predicted cancer probability." width="80%" />
