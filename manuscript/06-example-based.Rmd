## Example-based explanations

Example-based explanations are methods that return instances from the dataset to explain the behaviour of a black box machine learning model.
Difference to model-agnostic methods:
The methods always yield an instance, not a summary; 
The methods might be applied before fitting a model to explain the dataset, by which the behaviour of the model can be understood better.


This chapter covers: 

- Prototypes: Which instances from the data are stereotypical for certain classes?
- Criticisms: Which instances from the data are a bit unusual for certain classes?
- Counterfactuals: How would the instance look like if we want to flip the prediction?
- Adverserial examples: Same as counterfactuals, but with the purpose to maliciously fooling the machine learning algorithm.
- Archetypes?
- Anchors?
