# A look into the crystal ball

What will the future of machine learning and interpretability bring?

This chapter is a highly speculative and highly subjective view on the future. 

I believe model-agnostic methods is the way to go. 
Intrinsically interpretable methods will have a subordinate role, mostly as surrogate model, but not modelling the data itself. 


What data scientists and statisticians currently do: Model the data. 
What they will do in the future: Model the black box. 

Confidence intervals
p-values and tests for pdps, for local models, 
Error analysis for feature importance in the black box feature space. 

Complete separation of optimization for predicition and optimization for interpretation. 

We will get benchmarks and measures for how good interpretability is. 

AutoML + IML will be the norm

Automated data scientist. 

Automated scientist: Generation of hypothesis, testing, interpretation of results. 
Active learning 

Accelerating automation: Automation of the scientific process, automation of knowledge generation. 
Revolution of science (after the data revolution in which we are now).
