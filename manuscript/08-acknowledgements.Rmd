Writing this book was (and still) is a lot of fun!
But it's also a lot of work and I am very fortunate to have had some help and be build upon work of others.

I had some help for creating visuals: 
The cover was made by my friend [\@ArbeitAmText](https://twitter.com/ArbeitAmText). 
The graphics in the Shapley Value chapter are were made by [Abi Aryan](https://twitter.com/GoAbiAryan), using icons made by [http://www.freepik.com/](Freepik) from www.flaticon.com. 


Thanks also for all the [people who contributed](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/graphs/contributors) smaller fixes that I have gotten through pull request on github!

I am also grateful for having funding for my research from the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts in the framework of the Centre Digitisation.Bavaria (ZD.B).
