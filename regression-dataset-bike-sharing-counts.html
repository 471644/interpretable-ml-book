<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Regression dataset: Bike sharing counts</h2>
<p>This dataset contains daily counts of bike rentals from bike sharing company <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital-Bikeshare</a> in Washington D.C., including weather and seasonal information. The data is kindly open source by Capital-Bikeshare and the folks from <span class="citation">(Fanaee-T and Gama <a href="#ref-bike2013">2013</a>)</span> have added weather data and seasonal information. The goal is to predict how many rental bike will be out on the street given weather and day. The data can be downloaded from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>.</p>
<p>Variables in the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>instant: record index</li>
<li>dteday : date</li>
<li>season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)</li>
<li>yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)</li>
<li>mnth : month ( 1 to 12)</li>
<li>hr : hour (0 to 23)</li>
<li>holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from [Web Link])</li>
<li>weekday : day of the week</li>
<li>workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.</li>
<li>weathersit :</li>
<li>1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy</li>
<li>2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist</li>
<li>3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds</li>
<li>4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog</li>
<li>temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-8, t_max=+39 (only in hourly scale)</li>
<li>atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min), t_min=-16, t_max=+50 (only in hourly scale)</li>
<li>hum: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)</li>
<li>windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)</li>
<li>casual: count of casual users</li>
<li>registered: count of registered users</li>
<li>cnt: count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered</li>
