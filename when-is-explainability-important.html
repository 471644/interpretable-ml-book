<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> When is explainability important?</h2>
<p>AI explainability is the ability of a machine learning system to explain or to present a decision in an understandable way for humans. Machine learning has come to a state where you have to make a trade-off: Do you simply want to know <strong>what</strong> will happen? For example if a client will churn or if medication will work well for a patient. Or do you want to know <strong>why</strong> something will happen and paying for the explainability with accuracy? In some cases you will not care why a decision was made, only the assurance that the accuracy was good on some test set is enough. But in other cases knowing the ‘why’ can help you understand more about the problem, the data and also know why a model might fail. Two sorts of problems might not need explanations, because they either are low risk (e.g. movie recommender system) or the method is already extensively studied and evaluated (e.g. optical character recognition). The necessity for explainability comes from an incompleteness in the problem formalization <span class="citation">(Doshi-Velez and Kim <a href="#ref-Doshi-Velez2017">2017</a>)</span>, meaning that for certain problems/tasks it is not enough to get the answer (the “what”), but the model also has to give an explanation (the *why**)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a shift in many scientific disciplines <!--TODO> Add example disciplines--> from qualitative to quantitative methods (e.g. sociology, psychology), and also towards machine learning (biology, genomics). The <strong>goal of science</strong> is to gain knowledge, but many problems can only be solved with big datasets and black box machine learning models. Explainability allows to extract additional knowledge.</li>
<li>It is <strong>human nature</strong> wanting to understand things, to have some form of control.</li>
<li>Machine learning models are taking over real world tasks, that demand <strong>safety measurements</strong> and testing. A self-driving car automatically detects cyclists, which is as desired. You want to bet 100% sure that the abstraction the system learned will be fail-safe, because running over cyclists is quite bad. An explanation might reveal that the most important feature learned is to recognize the two wheels of a bike and this explanation helps to think about edge cases like bikes with side bags, that partially cover the wheels.</li>
<li>By default most machine learning models pick up biases from the training data. This can turn your machine learning models into racists (see Microsoft failed experiment: Tay) or discriminate in against other demographic, protected groups. Explainability helps you to get the <strong>ethics</strong> of your machine learning model right. From the data it might not be possible to see the biases, so it might also not be enough to implement protections against known biases. An example: The goal is to train a machine learning model to pre-sort applications for jobs in a big company. The company had some troubles in the past because they preferred to hire men over women, having the same qualifications. So for the model training the data scientist decides to remove all features that indicate the gender. But it turns out that the model picks up another, a priori unknown, bias favoring younger people over older people. This could only be uncovered because the model is explainable.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is not possible to optimize a goal directly, but only a proxy. Consider a marketing where a e-commerce company sends some gift to some customers in order to bind them to the business. It has already done similar campaigns, so there is data to learn a model to select the best customers to send the gifts to (sending it to all would be far to expensive). Ideally the company wants to optimize the likelihood that the customers with the gift are still their customers in five years from now, but there is no data for optimizing this goal directly, because the first of theses kinds of campaigns was two years ago, meaning there is no suitable training data for this objective. So the company opts for using a proxy: The amount of money the customers will be spending in the next 6 months at your company. An explainable model can help to find problems that might arise due to using a proxy objective (possibly <strong>mismatched objectives</strong>). In the e-commerce example it might turn out that the customers selected by the algorithm are only international students that might spent heavily in a short time, even more after receiving a gift, but usually leave the country and therefore the company as a customer within a few years.In many scientific questions, like in longitudinal observational studies, the researcher wants to uncover causal relationships, like the therapy effect on some disease outcome measurement, but all algorithms only pick up and optimize the correlation which the researcher is only interested in if it is causal.</li>
<li>In volatile environments a machine learning model might be outdated at some point because of a <strong>data shift</strong>. A data shift is a change in the relationships in the data. Explanation make it easier to detect when that happens or if one model is more prone than another to face problems soon. Spam filter for mails use works in a mail to detect if they should reach your inbox or be moved into the spam folder. ‘Viagra’ is one of the words that increase the likelihood that a mail is spam. When ‘viagra’ is suddenly used in a different context, for some obscure reason, suddenly non-spam mails will land in the spam folder (like ‘Random forests are basically a bunch of decision trees on viagra’). An investigation of this problem might reveal very quickly that the data shift (‘viagra’-occurrence / spam reluationship) is caused by the new use of the former spam related word. An explainable model could highlight in the text which sections caused the spam classification. A special case of a data shift is when the outcome of the machine learning model influences its environment and therefore its future training data. An example is the optimization of marketing campaigns. The machinee learning model influences which people will be targeted by the campaign and therefore influence who will be part of the future training set and also possibly invalidate its own predictions.</li>
<li>Another topic related to data shift is <strong>extrapolation</strong>. With simpler, interpretable models it is clearer how predictions will be handled for data points outside of the training data cluster.</li>
<li>Sometimes training of machine learning models happens with training data that comes from a different distribution as the live data with which the model will be confronted with in production. The machine learning team basically trains the model on the dedicated training dataset, crosses their fingers and put it into production. The hope is, that the learned associations between the features and the output has a good <strong>generalization to new data</strong>. The training data for a fracture detection machine learning model might come from labeled radiographs that were done with a handful of different x-ray devices. But the company hopes to use their fracture detection algorithm in their software that they sell to hundreds of hospitals that likely use different machines. Explainable machine learning models can give the engineers the confidence that the model only picked up relationships that will generalize well for new datasets.</li>
<li>Even if the problem formalization is complete, there might be an unknown <strong>trade-off between objectives</strong> like predictive ability and not being racis. A machine learning model that decides for a bank whether customers should receive a loan or not has many objectives to take care of: For the bank it is important that the customers will pay their loan back and not default. This can be directly optimized by training on historical data with customer data and information if they defaulted on a loan or not. The customers with the best scores (highest probability of paying back the loan without problems) are the ones the bank would want to give a loan. At the same time the bank has to ensure that the algorithm is not discriminating against a demographic minority like race or religion. Also there might be other regulatory or legal requirements the bank has to be aware of when giving out loans. These additional objectives cannot be directly optimized, but explanations can fill the gap.</li>
<li>There might be <strong>legal requirements</strong> to have an explainable decision making process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these scenarios with an incompleteness to of the problem formalization, there is also the task of debugging a machine learning model, which is crucial and difficult. Explainability is a useful debugging tool for black box algorithm. So even in low risk environments (e.g. movie recommenders) explainability in the research and development stage is valuable. Also later when some model is used in a product, things can go wrong. And needed for explainability arises when something goes wrong. Because having an explanation for a faulty classification helps to understand the cause of the fault. It delivers a direction for how to fix the system. Consider an example of a husky versus wolf classifier, that missclassifies some huskies as wolfs. If there is an explanation to the classification you can see, that the missclassification happened due to the snow on the image. The classifier learned to use snow as a feature for classifying images as wolfs, which might make sense in terms of separating features in the training data set, but not in the real world use. <!--TODO: Add image from Ribeiro + ask for permission]--></p>
